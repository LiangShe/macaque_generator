Variational Autoencoder for MNIST

Initially re-organized from the example code from keras: 
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/variational_autoencoder_deconv.py

major improvments: 
1. wrapped VAE model with class
2. added save and load model for easier hyperparameter optimization
